#  Hospital Management SQL Analytics Dashboard 

## 1.  Background and Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing patient flow, doctor utilization, and revenue streams in a multi-specialty hospital setting. Using SQL queries and Power BI visualization, the dashboard provides actionable insights across patient demographics, treatments, billing, and operational inefficiencies.

The goal is to assist hospital administrators and decision-makers in improving patient care delivery, resource allocation, and financial management.

## 3.  Executive Summary

The dashboard uncovered several operational pain points in the hospitalâ€™s current setup:

- Uneven patient load distribution among doctors on peak days
- Over-reliance on a few high-performing doctors and treatments
- 30+ day unpaid bills contributing to poor cash flow
- High-value patients concentrated under select insurance providers

This highlights the need for a better scheduling system, targeted treatment planning, and more balanced insurance partnerships.
